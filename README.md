# Organization-chart
Powershell scripted created for government org
Powershell script with a Get-UserFromOrgChart function that pulls needed data from an excel spreadsheet of company employees then creates an array of employee objects with their email, supervisor email, job title and department. 
The second script takes in the current active directory csv then finds differences between job titles in the organization chart and active directory so can be updated
